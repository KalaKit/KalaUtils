KalaUtils is a lightweight C++ 20 library for Windows that is used as a wrapper for a bunch of string, file, git, window, input and os functions and variables. It can be easily reused across any projects and has no external dependecies.

# Prerequisites (when compiling from source code)

- Visual Studio 2022 (with C++ CMake tools and Windows 10 or 11 SDK)
- Ninja and CMake 3.30.3 or newer (or extract Windows_prerequsites.7z and run setup.bat)

To compile from source code simply run 'build_windows_release.bat' or 'build_windows_debug.bat' depending on your preferences then copy and attach the dll, lib and header files with your preferred way to your program source directory.

# How to set up
